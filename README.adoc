# Linuxrc development tools

This is a collection of scripts used to connect http://github.com[Github]
via http://jenkins-ci.org[Jenkins] to the https://build.opensuse.org[Open Build Service].

For these to work the git project must fulfill some requirements:

* there must be a `clean` or `distclean` make target that really cleans up
  everything
* there must be an `archive` target that creates a source tar file (details see
  below)

## Tools

### git2log

Generate a changelog file based on git commit messages.

If your commit message is split into a single line short comment and a
detailed description separated by an empty line, just the short comment is
used. Alternatively, precede each commit line with a dash '-' to get
multiple changelog entries.

Expects numerical tags matching version number, like 1.2.3. For branches !=
master, tags should be `<branch>-<version>`.

You can create test branches from any main branch (e.g. for pull requests,
with `git co -b`). _git2log_ recognizes those branches and treats them as
continuation of the main branch.

### tobs

Sample usage (submit current git state to `foo:bar:devel` devel project in
open build service:

```
tobs --target obs://foo:bar:devel
```

You can append a package name to the target spec, like:

```
tobs --target obs://foo:bar:devel/zap
```

This is useful if the git repository name and the package name differ.

There must be a make target `archive` that has created:

* a `VERSION` file
* a `changelog` file
* a source archive `package/<name>-<version>.tar.xz`
* optionally other source files (that will be mentioned in `+*.spec+`) below `package/`

Ideally, repeated make runs should produce exactly the same archive file as
long as the git repo stays unchanged.

The script gets the current build service package, updates it with the new
sources, adjust the `+*.spec+` file to remove any old patches, updates the
`+*.changes+` file and commits the new package back to the build service (to the
same project). It will auto-add comments about removed patches and
removed/added source files.

If it does not yet exist it creates a new version number tag in the git
repo.

Note that you need a `$HOME/.oscrc` file with sufficient authentication info
to access the build service and to write to the git repo (to push the tag).

There is a `--try` option that does everything except actually submitting
the changes to the build service or setting the new tag. Use together with
`--save-temp` to debug things.

#### tobs --sr

Sample usage (wait for the package to build sucessfully in `foo:bar:devel`,
then submit to `openSUSE:Factory`):

```
tobs --target obs://foo:bar:devel --sr obs://openSUSE:Factory --wait-for-ok
```

If you use the `--sr` option _tobs_ will create a build service submit request.
With `--wait-for-ok` it optionally waits until the package has been built
successfully in the development project.

#### $HOME/.tobsrc

_tobs_ uses a config file with basic data about the open build service. It
can also have a list of aliases for bvuild service projects.

It uses ini-file syntax.

Sample file:

```
[obs]
api=api.opensuse.org

[xbs]
api=api.example.org
prefix[obs]=openSUSE.org

[aliases]
factory=obs://openSUSE:Factory
devel-factory=obs://foo:bar:devel
```

This means

- `obs` refers to api.opensuse.org
- `xbs` refers to api.example.org
- `obs` can be accessed via `xbs` by using an `openSUSE.org` prefix to project names
- `factory` and `devel-factory` can be used as aliases in _tobs_ to specify projects; this means
+
--
```
tobs --target devel-factory --sr factory
```
would be equivalent to
```
tobs --target obs://foo:bar:devel --sr obs://openSUSE:Factory
```
--

### build_it

Wrapper script for _tobs_ to be run by Jenkins.

For example

```
build_it --target obs://foo:bar:devel --branch main
```

checks out branch `main`, runs `make archive`, and then `tobs` to submit the package.


### submit_it

Wrapper script for `tobs --sr` to be run by Jenkins.

For example

```
submit_it --target obs://foo:bar:devel/zap --sr obs://openSUSE:Factory
```

Waits for package `zap` to be built at `foo:bar:devel` and then submits to `openSUSE:Factory`.

## openSUSE development

### Workflow

At a first glance, Linuxrc (and related projects) follows the same approach as other YaST projects:
changes are tracked on Github and Jenkins CI will take care of submitting them to OBS. However,
tools used by these projects are different from the ones used for YaST.

Those tools are available in http://github.com/openSUSE/linuxrc-devtools[linuxrc-devtools].
Next we'll introduce them (and how are they related to Jenkins) but it's recommended to check the
https://github.com/openSUSE/linuxrc-devtools/blob/master/README.adoc[documentation]
in the repository.

When Jenkins detect changes on, for example,
http://github.com/openSUSE/linuxrc[linuxrc] Git repository, it will build the
project using the
https://github.com/openSUSE/linuxrc-devtools/blob/master/build_it[build_it] script.
This script is just a wrapper that, after building the `make archive` target,
will invoke
https://github.com/openSUSE/linuxrc-devtools/blob/master/tobs[tobs] which
will take care of submitting the new version to the development project on OBS.

If the previous step ran successfully, then a submit request to the final
project will be created through the
https://github.com/openSUSE/linuxrc-devtools/blob/master/submit_it[submit_it] script,
which is just another wrapper script that will rely on `tobs`.

### linuxrc-devtools

The package is automatically submitted from the `master` branch to
https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/system:install:head/linuxrc-devtools[system:install:head]
OBS project. From that place it is forwarded to
https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/openSUSE:Factory[openSUSE Factory].
